This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a loan applicant is a good or bad credit risk based on their financial and demographic data. It uses real-world datasets (application_record.csv and credit_record.csv) and demonstrates end-to-end ML development â€” from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
